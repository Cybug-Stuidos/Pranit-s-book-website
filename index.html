<h3>
My whole life I planned on going to
pilot school like the rest of my friends-
but I didn't get in! Then a green guy
named Yoda invited me to Jedi Academy.
Now I'm at a school with aliens, robot
and lightsaber-wielding bullies who can
lift things with their minds! How am I
Supposed to compete with that? As if
starting a new school isn't hard enough...

11-year-old Zach has magical power...
he just hasn't found them yet.

But when he starts at a regular secondary school with 
'normal' children, his powers are unlocked and bit of 
magic leads to him going viral on YouTube.

It attracts the attenion of Rachel, the loveliest girl
at school, but with everyone wondering how he does his
tricks, and mean girl Tricia plotting a major prank to
bring him down, Zach's got his work cut out to keep
his secret and survive Year Seven!

No scheme is too dastardly, no plot too devious.
And he's just discovered that fairies are real.

    Poor fairies.

But these are not the gentle creatures of bedtime stories.
They are armed.They are dangerous.

Then Artemis kidnaps elf Captain Holly Short in an 
attempt to ransom her for fairy gold. Holly is incredibly
dangerous, and pretty annoyed about that whole kidnapping
thing.

Artemis Fowl is about to find out that fairies fight back...
